
This folder contains our Matlab implementation of the new
edge-wise coupled (EWC) non-homogeneous dynamic Bayesian nework (NH-DBN) model.

The Matlab code is supplementary material for our paper:
'Non-homogeneous dynamic Bayesian networks with edge-wise sequentially coupled parameters'  
accepted by Bioinformatics on 27 August 2019

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

HOW TO GET STARTED WITH THE MATLAB CODE:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

(1) COPY ALL FILES INTO YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY

(2) Start Matlab and choose your working directory (via cd...)

(3) Open the script file 'SCRIPT_EWC_NHDBN.m'

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The file 'SCRIPT_EWC_NHDBN.m' contains a worked example
with Matlab commands and instructions.

The contents of the file 'SCRIPT_EWC_NHDBN.m' can be copied&pasted 
line-by-line into the Matlab command window.
